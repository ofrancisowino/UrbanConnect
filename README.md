## 🚧 Current Status: Early Development Phase

This is the **initial stage** of UrbanConnect. We're setting up foundational layouts and design structures. The site will evolve into a dynamic platform with user-friendly navigation and seamless service booking.

---

## 🧠 Vision & Core Idea

UrbanConnect acts like a **digital broker**, allowing clients to:

- Select a service (e.g. Apartments)
- Filter by location, package, class, and category
- View multiple properties or services with full media previews
- Book viewing sessions with flexible payment options
- Connect to premium, verified service providers

---

## 🛠️ Technologies (Planned)

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Phase 1)
- Backend: Node.js / Express or Django (Future)
- Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- API integrations for maps, 3D tours, and payments (M-Pesa, Crypto, Banks)

## 🗺️ Example: Apartment Booking Flow (MVP)

> Client chooses:
1. **Service** → Apartments
2. **Location** → e.g. Mombasa
3. **Residence Area** → e.g. Nyali
4. **Package** → Premium
5. **Type** → Bedsitters
6. **Class** → e.g. Class R (group of 3 similar apartments)
7. **Apartment Details Page** → media, prices, services, location, availability
8. **Book Viewing**:
   - Random Fixing: Admin coordinates
   - Detailed Preference: Client selects preferences
   - Pay → Get e-ticket confirmation
